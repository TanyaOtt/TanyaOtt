- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TanyaOtt.  Iâ€™m on the journalism faculty at Mercer University, where I teach data journalism and media entrepreneurship (as well as other stuff). 
- Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and will soon start a refresher on python. Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that explore newsworthy public policy issues and research projects related to media processes and effects (particularly interested in spread of dis/misinformation), as well as media organizational practices (I recently used python to scrape a journalism jobs website in order to analyze the language of advertisements)  
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at ott-fulmore_tl@mercer.edu
